# MusicAuthenticator

## Overview

This is Proof Of Concept (POC) from a Python application that takes input from most of the music keyboards (piano) or any MIDI-based keyboard, it listens for a hardcoded sequence of notes, and compares it to a predefined correct melody, and authenticates accordingly. If the correct melody is played, the app prints "unlocked"; otherwise, it prints "locked".
The concept is rather simple but it can be used in many innovative applications and allow music-oriented people to use music as their "passwords".

Note: There is closed-source product that is currently being developed based on this concept. However, this POC is published publicly so everyone can use it, improve it and be inspired from it.

## Features

- **MIDI Input**: Captures real-time MIDI input from a connected keyboard.
- **Sequence Comparison**: Compares the played melody against a predefined sequence.
- **Simple Feedback**: Outputs "unlocked" or "locked" based on whether the melody matches. This can be easily adapted to call different methods, doing different actions accordingly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **MIDI Keyboard / Device**: Ensure your MIDI keyboard is connected to your computer through USB.
- **Python Packages**: Install the required packages by running:

    ```bash
    pip install mido python-rtmidi
    ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.

### Running the App

1. Ensure your MIDI keyboard is connected and recognized by your system.
2. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Play the melody on your MIDI keyboard.
4. The app will print either "unlock" or "lock" depending on whether the correct melody was played.

### Example

The current predefined correct sequence is:

```python
correct_sequence = [60, 62, 64, 65, 67]  # C, D, E, F, G
```

Note: The sequence can be changed to whatever melody you want, referencing from the table:

## Troubleshooting

No MIDI Input: Ensure your MIDI keyboard is connected and recognized by your system.
Incorrect Notes Detected: Double-check the correct sequence and ensure the notes are played accurately.

## Future Enhancements
For those who want to make it's own custom product from this POC, this is where I would suggest you to continue:

- UI/UX: Implement a graphical interface for better interaction.
- Error Tolerance: Allow minor mistakes in the melody by implementing a fuzzy matching algorithm.
- Additional Features: Add support for chords, tempo detection, or more complex melody patterns.
- API Integration (If the melody is valid, make an API call that authenticates)
